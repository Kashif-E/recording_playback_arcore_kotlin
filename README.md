# ArCore Recording and Playback API kotlin implementation
Place 3d objects on a 2d video using Google #arcore recording and playback API. Google announced this API on  Google IO this year. It has many use cases and can make use of AR much easier, for both android developers and augmentedreality users. Imagine you are sitting in your office but have to check if an IKEA desk, Homedepot bathroom decorating idea will look good in your space? an appliance from Amazon or the new colorful imac2021 from Apple, you don't have to go back home just open the video and add a 3d model on the video you had previously recorded. All the examples in Arcore SDK are in java, So i made this Kotlin for those who do not have experience with Java.
